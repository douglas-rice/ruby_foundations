# Do a few practice rounds on using pseudo-code to guide your problem solving logic.

# Write out in pseudo-code a method that returns the sum of two integers.

# SET                 => sets a variable we can use for later

# PRINT               => displays output to user
# READ                => retrieve value from variable
